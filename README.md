# Reminder webapp Project
Reminder Project

# About this APP
The reminder app was created to provide users with a time management tool. It is
designed to alert users close to important events that they have input into the
program. It also gives users the option to track the status of their tasks and the
subtasks associated with the task. By helping users to track their important tasks,
this app will likely improve users’ productivity and reduce their stress of figuring out
what they might have forgotten.

Unlike a traditional reminder list or a to-do list, this reminder app has included some
social media components. It allows users to keep a profile picture. Moreover, it
allows users to add friends and share reminders with their friends. This function can
benefit teams by improving the management of their collective time. It can also
benefit friends who are planning events together and want to organize their tasks.
